# Music-Player
This music player app is very basic app to learn how to play music and audio in android using MediaPlayer class. 

Media player is used to play media files. These files are audio and video files. It can also be used to play audio and video streams over the network. 
But now I will use it to play a song that we need.
The song will be saved in a new folder called RAW folder.
